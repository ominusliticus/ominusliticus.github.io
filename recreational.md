Lastly, as a continuing side project, I am developing a high-enrgy experiment
visualization software, that would allow users to watch interactive, 3D renderings
of their simulations.
My hope is that this tool can be used both for science communication, c.f.
visualizations of black hole mergers, and as tool to drive experimental research
design.
My goal is to have VizQGP seemlessly interface with existing libraries such as
[Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) and [art](https://art.fnal.gov/).
