My research interest are quite broad, but confined to the world of field theories.
At my core, I wish to understand all the rich phenomena offered by Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), and by proxy, non-Abelian gauge theories.
I am intersted in hadron spectroscopy, in particular understanding the structure of
exotic hadrons. 
My reseach has focused on the charmed exotic tetraquarks, which can be explained as
loosely-bound charm-meson molecules, as they form a unique system that lends itself
well to analytic calculation.
I am interested in relativistic hydrodynamics and quark-gluon plasmas.
I also want to understand the cold, dense nuclear matter.
I want to understand the non-trivial topological nature of QCD, and the roles
that anomalies play in nature.
I prefer first principles calculations over model building, for this reason I hope
to understand and execute lattice field theoretic calculations.

In my current research, I wish to generalize the language of topological
hydrodynamics to the relativistic case.
My hope is to understand the spin-evolution for polarized heavy-ion experiments,
and to study the formation magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies, such as
magnetars.

Lastly, as a continuing side project, I am developing a high-enrgy experiment
visualization software, that would allow users to watch interactive, 3D renderings
of their simulations.
My hope is that this tool can be used both for science communication, c.f.
visualizations of black hole mergers, and as tool to drive experimental research
design.
My goal is to have VizQGP seemlessly interface with existing libraries such as
[Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) and [art](https://art.fnal.gov/).
