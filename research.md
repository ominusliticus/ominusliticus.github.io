## High Energy Phenomenology (Graduate Research)

All of my published research has been in hadron spectroscopy.
However, my interest are broader than understanding hadron structure.
### Exotic Particles
In the early 2000's, evidence of the first hadron containing more than three quarks was found.
Due its unknown nature and measured mass, it became known as the $$X(3872)$$.
Since them many more $$XYZ$$ states and other tetra- and pentaquark states have been discovered.
However, the $$X(3872)$$, the oldest with the greatest amount of data collect, continues to evade
a theoretical consensus on its hadronic structure.
I fall into the group that believe that the $$X$$ is a remarkable example of a loosely-bound
charm-meson molecule,
The past 4 years have been dedicated to making prediction for experiments to confirm,
under this assumption the assumption that the $$X$$ is a loosely-bound charm-meson molecule.
### Relativistic Hydrodynamics and Quark-Gluon Plasma
There is not yet any evidence of my work in this field, but I have also been studying
the evolution of an expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), under the assumption that it can be
described as a fluid.
It is well known that a relativistic formulation of Navier-Stokes theory is acausal, as it 
has a linearly growing dispersion relation.
This has led to many different formulations of relativistic hydrodynamics, using the language
of effect field theories.
These theories have different assumption built into them, meaning that they may describe certain
regions of parameter space well, while giving complete garbage in others.

To address the concern of validity, or applicability, of a hydrodynamic theory in a particular
region, researchers have turned to Bayesian model comparison.
In this way, hydrodynamic models can be sorted by seeing which gives the largest likelihood.
Moreover, one can scan parameter space and parameterize which theory performs best.

## High Energy Phenomenology (Post-Doctoral Research)
Ideally, if I get the post-doc I dream of, I will begin to focus my research interest on 
understanding high energy density systems more.
This includes quark-gluon plasmas and nuclear stars.
I believe that there is yet untapped area research that tries to understand spin and angular
momentum evolution in QGPs, though preliminary efforts are underway.
I am particularly interested in applying the language of topological hydro dynamics to 
relativistic spin hydrodynamics and understand if there is any meaningful insight to be gained 
there.

Beyond that, I enjoy understanding physical processes from first principals.
Not model building, and trying to interpret what the underlying physics might be based on
observation.
To this end, understand TMDs and GPDs is on my checklist, unraveling the mysterious of
the non-perturbative structure of hadrons further is on my checklist, and
learning lattice QFT methods is on my checklist.
To the best of my knowledge, no numerical solutions to classical non-Abelian gauge theories
have been made.
I want to understand how to extract topological solutions from differential equations numerically.
### More peripheral ideas
I am currently working on some software called VizQGP that will allow the real-time visualization of
high energy processes such as heavy-ion collisions.
The hope is that this would serve both as an excellent educational tool for science outreach,
assist experimentalists in creating analysis pipelines, and help theorist build intuition 
for themselves.
At its core, the VizQGP will play high energy process like video games where you have
the ability to start and stop the simulation and move around the interaction areas to have
different views of the same process.
The eventual hope is to integrate VizQGP into the existing [art](https://art.fnal.gov/)
framework such that each experiment using the art framework for detector simulation can
have access to real-time events.
