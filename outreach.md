## Undergrad Outreach

I started outreach work while in undergrad.
Some friends and I got together and decided we should start an after-school 
mentoring and tutoring programs in the underserved communities in our city.
We contacted school principals and recruited student volunteers from our
university, and regularly went into three middles schools to tutor.
Sadly, after two years, as people progressed in their degrees, less people
were willing to continue tutoring, and we failed to continue to recruit new 
volunteers.
Eventually, the schools terminated the programs due to lack of mentors and
a high demand from middle-schoolers.

My second organization focused on increasing undergradaute representation
in university research.
The organzation was backed by the Office of Undergradaute Research.
We held socials for current researchers, invited alumnis who had completed
undergraduate research and went into first-year experience course to 
present on the undergraduate research

## Graduate Outreach

In graduate school, I was recruited to help with
[Polaris](https://physics.osu.edu/student-organizations-0/polaris-0).
Polaris's mission is to increase the retention of underrepresented minorities
in physics and astronomy at Ohio State.
I helped raise funds and co-authored the proposal for an early-arrival 
program for undergraduates; co-authored the organizations constitution to 
ensure institutional memory; and help run the day-to-day activities of
the group.
Our two ongoing initiaves consist of a university listed mentorship course
and the early arrival program.
Our class now boasts a proud 50 students!
