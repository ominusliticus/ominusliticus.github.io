  <h2> About Me </h2>

  Hi!
  My name is Kevin Ingles, I am a theoretical and computational physicist studying nuclear, particle physics, and quantum algorithms. 
  Currently, I am a Senior Computational Research Scientist at Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA).
  Previously, I was a NSF MPS-Ascend Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
  working with Drs. Jaki Noronha-Hostler and Jorge Noronha to develop spin and 
  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions.
  I obtained my Ph.D. from The Ohio State University studying production mechanism for exotic heavy mesons.

  This is my personal website, where I keep track of my experiences and allow others to find me.
  I also use this website to publish any notes that I write, which might be useful for young researchers and certainly would have helped me
  when I was still in school.

  __Note: If this message is here, it means the website is out of date. I am working on updating it as soon as possible.__

  <h2> My Notes </h2>

  On the _My Notes_ tab, you will find notes that I have been developing over the years, to help myself,
  my peers and future students along their career.
  For now, they are primarily programming oriented, but will include my physics based things down the line.
  All of the information provided there can be used royality free with no citations necessary.
  Enjoy!
