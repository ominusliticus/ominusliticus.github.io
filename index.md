  <h2> About Me </h2>

  Hi!
  My name is Kevin Ingles, I am a theoretical physicist studying nuclear and particle physics. 
  Currently, I am a NSF MPS-Ascend Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
  working with Drs. Jaki Noronha-Hostler and Jorge Noronha to develop spin and 
  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions.
  Such a numeical framework will allow us to make even better inferences about the nature of the quark-gluon
  plasma (the most dense and hottest state of matte known), and improve our understanding the quantum 
  chromodynamics, the theory underlying the strong interactions.
  Aside from advancing our knowledge of fundamental physics, this code will also bring hydrodynamic simulations
  of relativistic fluids closer to state-of-the-art in terms of non-relativistic fluid simulations and 
  astrophysical plasma simulations.
  More generally, I am interested in the gauge theories as a whole.
  They have very rich phenomonology such as confinement, asymptotic freedom, and vanishing viscosity, and 
  our existing tools are still insufficient to fully understand all of these.

  My gaol is to to become a tenured professor at a HBCU, R2 university, or liberal arts college,
  as my passion is largely in mentoring aspiring scientists.
  Mentoring and facilitating mentorship programs has been an avid part of my career so far.
  In graduate school, this has primarily been through the student-led organization 
  [Polaris](https://physics.osu.edu/student-organizations-0/polaris-0).
  While during my postdoc, I have focused on roles in [Access](https://accessnetwork.org/) and the UofI program [IPaSS](https://ipass.physics.illinois.edu/).
  I take outreach and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Access (IDEA) work very seriously,
  and will continue advocating for such initiatives wherever I go.

  <h2> My Notes </h2>

  On the _My Notes_ tab, you will find notes that I have been developing over the years, to help myself,
  my peers and future students along their career.
  For now, they are primarily programming oriented, but will include my physics based things down the line.
  All of the information provided there can be used royality free with no citations necessary.
  Enjoy!
