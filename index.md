# About me

  Hi!
  My name is Kevin Ingles, I am a theoretical physicist studying theoretical
  nuclear and particle at The Ohio State University.
  In graduate school I have primarily been concerned with the phenomenology of Quantum
  Chromodynamics (QCD).
  I have studied topics such as quark-gluon plasmas, hadron spectroscopy and some axion 
  phenomenology.
  QCD is a very rich theory due to its non-Abelian nature, and lends itself to a wealth
  of theoretical methods to study it such as effective field theories, lattice calculations,
  and the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  Some open questions that I am interested in are: the structure of hadrons, the evolution
  of spin a relativistic plasma, the QCD equation of state, and emergence in QCD in general.

  My hope is to to become a tenured professor at a HBCU, R2 university, or liberal arts college,
  as my passion is largely in mentoring aspiring scientists.
  Mentoring and facilitating mentorship programs has been my second largest preoccupation
  during graduation school.
  This has primarily been through our organization 
  [Polaris](https://physics.osu.edu/student-organizations-0/polaris-0).
  I take outreach and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Access (IDEA) work very seriously,
  and will continue advocating for such initiatives wherever I go.
  I also have great interest in understanding and developing leadership structures and
  student-driven organization with a focus on building organizations the last, and developing
  more equitable teaching practices in classrooms.
