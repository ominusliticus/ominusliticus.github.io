  Hi!
  My name is Kevin Ingles, I am a theoretical physicist studying nuclear and particle physics. 
  Currently, I am a NSF MPS Ascend Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
  working with Drs. Jaki Noronha-Hostler and Jorge Noronha to develop spin and 
  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions to resolve the tension between current 
  theoretical predictions and experimental observations.
  For my Ph.D. I studied the properties of loosely bound charm-meson molecules in warm pion baths as 
  first step to understand why the $$X(3872)$$ might survive the conditions in heavy-ion collisions.
  Some general, open questions that I am interested in are: the structure of hadrons, the evolution
  of spin a relativistic plasma, the QCD equation of state, and emergence in QCD in general.

  My hope is to to become a tenured professor at a HBCU, R2 university, or liberal arts college,
  as my passion is largely in mentoring aspiring scientists.
  Mentoring and facilitating mentorship programs has been my second largest preoccupation
  during graduate school.
  This has primarily been through our organization 
  [Polaris](https://physics.osu.edu/student-organizations-0/polaris-0).
  I take outreach and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Access (IDEA) work very seriously,
  and will continue advocating for such initiatives wherever I go.
  I also have great interest in understanding and developing leadership structures and
  student-driven organization with a focus on building organizations the last, and developing
  more equitable teaching practices in classrooms.
