# About me

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
  <div sytle="text-align: just;" markdown="1">
  I am currently a graduate student at The Ohio State University where I study theoretical particle physics.
  My primary research interest lies at understanding all the rich phemomena that result from a non-Abelian gauge theory.
  More than my passion for research and learning, I have a passion for mentoring and this passion sits at the core
  my wanting to become a college professor.
  Aside from academics, I also enjoy programming, weight-lifting, any encarnation manga and youtubing all night.
