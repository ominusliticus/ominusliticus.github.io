# Some background

## Main goals of people in leadership
Important aspects to pay attention to when leading a team are:
- [Setting the climate](#setting-the-climate)
- [Making decision](#making-decision)
- [Inspiring others](#inspiring-others)
- [Setting values](#setting-values)
- [Facilitating communication](#facilitating-communication)
- [Developing leadership skills](#developing-leadership-skills)
- [Problem solving](#problem-solving)
    
We develop these aspects with activities designed for each skill.
A key principal to keep in mind while engaging in these activities is to focus on collaboration and communication.
We want to operator from the frame of mind that we are all equals, and our opinions should be equally heard.


### Setting the climate
Leaders' leadership style, principles, and values determine the culture of the team.
Leadership training should start with the fundamentals of respect and empathy.
Good leaders are able to bring many perspective together to be productive.
Great leadership teams leverage their diverse perspectives to accomplish their goals.
Being aware and making room for others opinions and thoughts is important for effective and inclusive leadership.

Possible activities include:
- [Leadership Envelopes](#leadership-envelopes)
- [Leadership Pizza](#leadership-pizza)


### Making decisions
One of the most important functions for members of a leadership is the _making of decisions_.
Being cognizant of others opinions and incorporating there opinions is a good way to ensure everyone feels valued.
A general rule of thumb employed within Access is the _consensus rule_ which states that all decisions must pass by consensus, that is, everyone present to vote must agree on the action/measure taken.
As highly collaborative teams communication is key.

Some activities to hone our team-based decision making skills are:
- Variation of [Level of Influence](#level-of-influence)
- [Leadership Dilemma](#leadership-dilemma)


### Inspiring others
As leaders, we often serve as role models for others.
We can reflect on ourselves and ask what sort of role models we present for the people at our local sites.

Some activities to can stimulate this introspection are:
- [Living Core Values](#living-core-values)
- [Letter from the Future](#letter-from-the-future)


### Setting values
As leaders, our personal values tend to influence and be reflected in our organizations.
Valuing competiton and individual success can breed a competitive environment.
Valuing shared leadership and equity can lead a highly collaborative and community focues enviornment.

Activites that allow us to share our values, and perhaps help people put into words their own values are:
- [Your Leadership Coat of Arms](#your-leadership-coat-of-arms)
- [Team Purpose and Culture]($team-purpose-and-culture)


### Facilitating communication
The importance of this aspect speaks for itself.
We should all be cognizant of whether we are being active listners or providing effective feedback.
Apparently, the number one barrier to successful leadership is the avoidance of tough conversations. 
- [Trust Battery](#trust-battery)
- [Start,  Stop, Continue](#start-stop-continue)


### Developing leadership skills
Activities include
- [Blind Square Rope Game](#blind-square-rope-game)
- [Minefield](#minefield)

### Problem Solving


# Lesson Plan


## Planned Activities
Here I enumerate and describe the possible leadership skills development activites that we can engage in.
All these activities were taken from [here](https://www.sessionlab.com/blog/leadership-activities/#leadership-activities-for-setting-a-great-workplace-climate).

### Leadership Envelopes
A full description can be found [here](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/leadership-envelopes)

### Leadership Pizza

### Level of Influence
The usual description of this activity can be found [here](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/level-of-influence).
However, we will do a variation where instead of deciding what task to prioritize completing, we will have people
rank what steps need to be taken to complete project/experiment (ideal something where people don't have much experience).  
**TO BE FLUSHED OUT**

### Leadership Dilemma
This will be based on the [''Hazing Prevention Consortium'' activity](https://stophazing.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Values-Based-Leadership-Decision-Making-Workshop-2.pdf).
The topics involved are pretty heavy, so we will have to think about switching them.
