# Some background

## Main goals of people in leadership
Important aspects to pay attention to when leading a team are:
- [Setting the climate](#setting-the-climate)
- [Making decision](#making-decision)
- [Inspiring others](#inspiring-others)
- [Setting values](#setting-values)
- [Facilitating communication](#facilitating-communication)
- [Developing leadership skills](#developing-leadership-skills)
- [Problem solving](#problem-solving)
    
We develop these aspects with activities designed for each skill.
A key principal to keep in mind while engaging in these activities is to focus on collaboration and communication.
We want to operator from the frame of mind that we are all equals, and our opinions should be equally heard.


### Setting the climate
Leaders' leadership style, principles, and values determine the culture of the team.
Leadership training should start with the fundamentals of respect and empathy.
Good leaders are able to bring many perspective together to be productive.
Great leadership teams leverage their diverse perspectives to accomplish their goals.
Being aware and making room for others opinions and thoughts is important for effective and inclusive leadership.

Possible activities include:
- [Leadership Envelopes](#leadership-envelopes)
- [Leadership Pizza](#leadership-pizza)


### Making decisions
One of the most important functions for members of a leadership is the _making of decisions_.
Being cognizant of others opinions and incorporating there opinions is a good way to ensure everyone feels valued.
A general rule of thumb employed within Access is the _consensus rule_ which states that all decisions must pass by consensus, that is, everyone present to vote must agree on the action/measure taken.
As highly collaborative teams communication is key.

Some activities to hone our team-based decision making skills are:
- Variation of [Level of Influence](#level-of-influence)
- [Leadership Dilemma](#leadership-dilemma)

## Planned Activities

All these activities were taken from [here](https://www.sessionlab.com/blog/leadership-activities/#leadership-activities-for-setting-a-great-workplace-climate).

### Leadership Envelopes

### Level of Influence
The usual description of this activity can be found [here](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/level-of-influence).
However, we will do a variation where instead of deciding what task to prioritize completing, we will have people
rank what steps need to be taken to complete project/experiment (ideal something where people don't have much experience).  
**TO BE FLUSHED OUT**

### Leadership Dilemma
This will be based on the [''Hazing Prevention Consortium'' activity](https://stophazing.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Values-Based-Leadership-Decision-Making-Workshop-2.pdf).
The topics involved are pretty heavy, so we will have to think about switching them.
